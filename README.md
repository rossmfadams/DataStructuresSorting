# DataStructuresSorting
A group project implementing various sorting algorithms and evaluating thembase
on speed.
@authors Ross Adams, Caitlyn Phan, and Justin Krikorian
Fall 2019

The following sorting algorithms are included:
Slow - O(n^2) time complexity
	Selection Sort
	Insertion Sort

Fast - O(n log n) time complexity
	Merge Sort
	Quick Sort
	Shell Sort

These algorithms were then benchmarked on a randomly generated Array of
5000 integers.
